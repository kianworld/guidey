# Guidey
Guidey was my capstone project for my Morehead State University Computer Science degree. Worked on for two semesters, with some prototypes and skeletons made in the first semester and actual implementation worked on in the second.

The goal was to make a new TV guide web application with the ability to set manual and automatic reminders that other sites like Zap2it could not do. I was able to get manual reminders implemented but automatic reminders do not seem like a possibility with the specific schedule API used.

The API used was Schedules Direct. You **must use an active Schedules Direct account** to access the service, which costs money.
